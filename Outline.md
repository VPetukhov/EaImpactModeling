  - "We are concerned about untrained amateurs going directly into trying to solve very difficult and pressing global problems. They can then cause harm overall, by lowering the average quality of analysis or launching ill-considered projects due to a lack of experience or understanding. A PhD reduces the risk you’ll accidentally do this."

Parameters:
- Personal fit
- Impact of the area
- Impact within the area

Other parameters:
- Competition


## Considerations


- Companies aren't sampled randomly: there is no chance we randomly open something better than FHI
  - Should I create complex distribution, which first samples some top companies, and then the rest are from lower-impact distribution?


## Task list

- [ ] Convert "distribution_properties" plots to VegaLite
- [ ] Update "organization_impacts" plots to use IM wrappers 
- [ ] Add geometric mean parameter to "impact_estimation" functions
- [ ] Copy outline from "Optimal allocation ... .docx" here
